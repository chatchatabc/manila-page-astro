Flores de Mayo, also known as the "Flowers of May" festival, is a popular Filipino tradition celebrated every year in the month of May. It is a month-long festival that honors the Virgin Mary and is celebrated in different parts of the country, particularly in the provinces. The festival is a combination of religious and cultural activities that involve street parades, processions, and beauty pageants.

During the Flores de Mayo festival, young girls dress up in colorful gowns and wear crowns of flowers as they participate in the "Santacruzan" parade. The Santacruzan is a religious procession that commemorates the finding of the Holy Cross by Queen Helena and her son, Constantine the Great.

The procession is led by a statue of the Virgin Mary and is joined by different characters, including angels, biblical figures, and historical personalities. The parade ends at the church, where a mass is held in honor of the Virgin Mary.

Aside from the Santacruzan, the Flores de Mayo festival also includes other activities such as flower exhibitions, beauty pageants, and cultural shows. It is a time for Filipinos to come together and celebrate their faith and culture, and to honor the Virgin Mary, who is considered the Queen of May.

### Tracing Centuries of Faith

Construction of the cathedral started in 1571, just a few years after the arrival of the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi in the Philippines. The original structure was made of bamboo and nipa, but it was repeatedly destroyed by fires and earthquakes. The present-day cathedral was constructed in 1958, after the previous one was heavily damaged during the Battle of Manila in World War II.
